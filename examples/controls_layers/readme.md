# Controls Layers

This script adds extra layers for the MIDI continuous controllers. Layers 
can be switched by a dedicated continuous controller and a GUI widget. 

The script also saves received feedback for each layer and sends it to 
controller on layer selection.

## Prerequisites

- 'To DAW' and 'From DAW' virtual ports.
- Replace `'MIDI Controller'` with your MIDI controller port name.
- Set 'To DAW' virtual port as an input in your DAW.
- Set 'From DAW' virtual port as an output from your DAW.
