# Controls Banks

![](/examples/controls_banks/screenshot.png)

Script that adds extra banks for the MIDI continuous controllers. 
Banks can be switched by a dedicated continuous controller and a GUI widget. 

The script also saves received feedback for each bank and sends it to 
controller on bank selection.

## Prerequisites

- Replace `'MIDI Controller'` with your MIDI controller port name.
- Set `'DAW'` virtual ports as an input and output in your DAW.
