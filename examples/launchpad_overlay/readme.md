# Launchpad X overlay for Ableton Live

This script overrides messages from the 4 top "scene launch" pads of 
Novation Launchpad X to Ableton Live. 
The pads will select scenes instead of launching them
which is useful for session record. 
The script also implements feedback to controller on scene selection 
and a GUI button to disable the overlay.

## Prerequisites

- [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) 
to set and get the selected scene.
- Set virtual ports as proxies for Launchpad X:
